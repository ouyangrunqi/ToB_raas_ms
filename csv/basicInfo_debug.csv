The term Europe refers to European countries including, Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union countries but excludes the United Kingdom. Depending on market conditions, the Fund will aim to invest in equity securities of companies that are, in the investment adviser’s (IA) opinion, undervalued (i.e. their share price does not reflect their underlying worth) or have good growth potential. The IA may use financial derivative instruments (FDIs) (i.e. investments the prices of which are based on one or more underlying assets) for investment purposes in order to achieve the investment objective of the Fund, and/or to reduce risk within the Fund’s portfolio, reduce investment costs and generate additional income. The Fund may, via FDIs, generate varying amounts of market leverage (i.e. where the Fund gains market exposure in excess of the value of its assets).

In doing so the IA will refer to the FTSE World Europe ex UK Index when constructing the Fund’s portfolio, and also for risk management purposes to ensure that the active risk (i.e. degree of deviation from the index) taken by the Fund remains appropriate given the Fund’s investment objective and policy.

The IA may also use its discretion to invest in securities not included in the Index in order to take advantage of specific investment opportunities.

Portfolio securities The Sub-Fund invests mainly in shares of companies of varied size that are located, registered, or doing significant business in Japan. The Sub-Fund may also invest in bonds and currencies. Investment process In choosing investments, the investment manager looks for shares that are undervalued and that appear to have the potential to rise in price over the long term. The Sub-Fund may use derivatives for efficient portfolio management or to manage risks. Benchmark This Sub-Fund aims to outperform the return of MSCI Japan Index (""Benchmark""). The Sub-Fund is actively managed. The Benchmark is used as a reference point for portfolio construction. The majority of the Sub-Fund's equity securities will be components of, and have weightings derived from the Benchmark. The Investment Manager may use its discretion to overweight or underweight certain components of the Benchmark and may invest in companies or sectors not included in the Benchmark in order to take advantage of specific investment opportunities. It is thus expected that the performance of the Sub-Fund will materially deviate from the Benchmark. Base Currency JPY / Share class reference currency USD Your shares will be “hedged” with the aim of protecting them from exchange rate fluctuations between their denominated currency (the “Share class reference currency”) and the base currency of the Fund. Hedging also has the effect of limiting the potential for currency gains to be made. Recommendation This Sub-Fund may not be appropriate for investors who plan to withdraw their money within 7 years. Terms to Understand Bonds Securities that represent the obligation to repay a debt, with interest. Derivatives Financial instruments whose value is linked to one or more rates, indexes, share prices or other values. Shares Securities that represent an ownership stake in a company. You can place orders to buy or sell shares at any time. Orders placed before 2 PM (Luxembourg time) and on any day that is a banking day in Luxembourg and in the country or countries where the majority of the Sub-Fund's assets are invested will generally be processed that day.

The Fund invests at least 70% of its total assets in fixed income transferable securities and equity securities of issuers and companies domiciled in, or exercising the predominant part of their economic activity in, Asia, excluding Japan. The asset classes and the extent to which the Fund is invested in these may vary without limit depending on market conditions and other factors at the investment adviser’s (IA) discretion. In selecting these, the IA may take into consideration the MSCI Asia ex Japan Index (50%), the JP Morgan Asia Credit Index (25%) and the HSBC Local Bond Index (25%). The Fund’s investments may be issued by governments, government agencies, companies and supranationals (e.g. the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development). These may include securities with a relatively low credit rating or which are unrated. The assets held by the Fund may be denominated in a wide variety of currencies. The investment adviser (IA) may use financial derivative instruments (FDIs) (i.e. investments the prices of which are based on one or more underlying assets) for investment purposes in order to achieve the investment objective of the Fund, and/or to reduce risk within the Fund’s portfolio, reduce investment costs and generate additional income. The Fund may, via FDIs, generate varying amounts of market leverage (i.e. where the Fund gains market exposure in excess of the value of its assets). Recommendation: This Fund may not be appropriate for short-term investment. Your shares will be non-distributing (i.e. dividend income will be included in their value). Your shares will be denominated in US Dollar, the Fund's base currency. You can buy and sell your shares daily. The minimum initial investment for this share class is US$5,000 or currency equivalent.

Portfolio securities The Sub-Fund will invest primarily in equities and equity-related securities of companies, diversified across countries and sectors, which are incorporated, listed in or have their area of primary activity in the Asia Pacific ex-Japan Region. The Sub-Fund may also invest in depository receipts, including ADRs and GDRs, debt securities convertible into common shares, preference shares and warrants. Investment process In choosing investments, the investment manager starts with a broad Asia Pacific ex Japan universe of stocks and shortlists them on the basis of investability and desirable characteristics (e.g. value, positive analyst sentiment and quality among other factors). An optimization process then selects stocks from the shortlist and constructs a suitable low volatility portfolio with the desired characteristics. Constraints such as maximum stock weight, portfolio concentration, liquidity, sector, country and style relative exposures, etc. are applied in order to manage systematic and stock specific risk. Benchmark This Sub-Fund aims to outperform the return of MSCI AC Asia Pacific ex-Japan Minimum Volatility Index (""Benchmark""). The Sub-Fund is actively managed. The Benchmark is used as a reference point for portfolio construction. The majority of the Sub-Fund's equity securities will be components of, and have weightings derived from the Benchmark. The Investment Manager will use its discretion to overweight or underweight certain components of the Benchmark and may invest in companies or sectors not included in the Benchmark in order to take advantage of specific investment opportunities. It is thus expected that the performance of the Sub-Fund will moderately deviate from the Benchmark.
