Investment Policy: The Fund invests principally in a portfolio of corporate debt instruments worldwide, focusing on North American and European senior secured high yield instruments. Corporate debt instruments include bonds and notes. A high yield (sub-investment grade) debt instrument/security is one which carries a higher rate of interest, usually because the investors are accepting a higher degree of risk. However, senior secured debt instruments legally repay ahead of subordinated (non-senior) debt, 'secured' against collateral pledged by the debt issuer and typically carry a lower risk of loss than other debt instruments issued by the same corporation. The Fund is also permitted to invest to a lesser extent in other types of debt instruments such as unsecured high yield bonds, investment grade bonds, other Funds, cash and cash-equivalent securities and money market instruments. The Fund may use derivative instruments for both investment and hedging purposes. The return on a derivative is linked to movements in an underlying instrument referenced by the derivative such as currency or interest rates. The base currency of the Fund is USD. Distribution Policy: N/A - Income will be rolled up into the value of your investment. Dealing Frequency: Daily. Investors can buy and sell their shares on demand on each Business Day (as defined in the prospectus). Benchmark: ICE BoAML BB-B Global High Yield Secured Bond Index'. The Fund is actively managed and is not designed to track the Benchmark so its performance may deviate materially from the Benchmark. The investment manager has complete discretion in making investments and is not constrained by the Benchmark. The Fund may invest significantly in instruments which are not included in the Benchmark. The Benchmark is used only for risk management and performance comparison purposes. The investment manager may consider, for example, issuer exposures, duration, sector weights, country weights, credit ratings and tracking error in each case relative to the Benchmark but does not use the Benchmark as an investment limitation.
