Investment Policy: The fund invests primarily in an actively managed globally diversified portfolio which at least 80% of its Net Asset Value is invested in fixed income instruments. - The fixed income instruments in which the Fund invests may include government bonds, covered bonds, global corporate bonds, notes, debentures, government obligations and sovereign issues, commercial paper, asset-backed securities (“ABS”), commercial and residential- mortgage backed securities (“CMBS” and “RMBS”). The Fund may invest in investment grade and up to 50% of the Fund’s Net Asset Value in sub- investment grade fixed income instruments; up to 25% of its Net Asset Value in collateralised and/or securitised products such as covered bonds, ABS, CMBS and RMBS; and up to 10% of its Net Asset Value in securities issued and/or guaranteed by a single sovereign (including its government, a public or local government of that country) which is rated sub-investment grade. An investment grade fixed income security is one which carries a lower (but not zero) degree of risk than sub-investment grade fixed income securities, as such investment grade fixed income securities typically carry a lower rate of interest than higher yielding fixed income securities. - The fund may use derivative instruments for both investment and hedging purposes. The return on a derivative is linked to movements in an underlying instrument referenced by the derivative such as currency or interest rates. The base currency of the fund is USD. Distribution Policy: Income will be declared and distributed as a dividend semi-annually. Dealing Frequency: Daily. Investors can buy and sell their shares on demand on each Business Day (as defined in the prospectus and supplement). Benchmark: FTSE World Government Bond Index'. The fund is actively managed and is not designed to track the Benchmark so its performance may deviate materially from the Benchmark. The investment manager will manage global exposure of the fund to within 200% of the Benchmark's value-at-risk (""VaR”). The VaR of a fund is a daily estimation of the maximum loss which a fund may incur over a 1 day period. The investment manager has complete discretion in making investments and is not otherwise constrained by the Benchmark. The fund may invest significantly in instruments which are not included in the Benchmark. As well as this, the Benchmark is used only for risk management and performance comparison purposes. The investment manager may consider, for example, issuer exposures, duration, sector weights, country weights, credit ratings and tracking error in each case relative to the Benchmark but (other than as set out above) does not use the Benchmark as an investment limitation.

The fund invests primarily in a range of ""investment grade"" fixed income securities (which are loans that pay a fixed or variable rate of interest) issued by companies or governments from around the world. Securities will be priced in a range of global currencies. The investment advisor will choose securities with varying repayment dates based on its expectations for interest rate and exchange rate changes. The fund may invest substantially in emerging markets, which in investment terms are those economies that are still developing. Investment grade securities, as determined by international ratings agencies, whilst potentially producing a lower level of income than ""noninvestment grade"" securities, are also considered to be of lower risk. The fund may also invest up to 10% in securities which are rated lower than ""BBB"" but rated at least ""B"" by these same agencies. These are generally considered to be riskier investments but pay a higher income. The fund's benchmark is the Barclays Capital Global Aggregate Index (USD ). It is used to measure duration. Duration is the sensitivity of a fixed income security to a change in interest rates. The longer the duration of a fixed income security, the higher its sensitivity to interest rates.

The fund may invest in derivative instruments (such as futures, options and swaps) rather than directly in the underlying securities themselves.

The fund invests primarily in a range of ""high yield"" fixed income securities (which are loans that pay a fixed or variable rate of interest) issued by companies from around the world. These will mainly be priced in US Dollars but the fund may also hold other currencies as well as securities that are priced in other currencies. Investments may also be linked to emerging market countries, which in investment terms are those economies that are still developing. These high yield investments have a rating lower than ""Baa"" from Moody's or ""BBB"" from S&P, reflecting the higher risk of an institution defaulting on its payments. The fund may also invest up to 20% in lower rated securities of ""Caa"" and ""CCC"" by these same agencies. These are generally considered to be riskier investments but pay a higher income. The fund's benchmark is the BofA Merrill Lynch Global High Yield BB B Rated Constrained Index (USD ). It is used to measure duration. Duration is the sensitivity of a fixed income security to a change in interest rates. The longer the duration of a fixed income security, the higher its sensitivity to interest rates. For full investment objectives and policy details please refer to the prospectus. The fund may invest in derivative instruments (such as futures, options and swaps) rather than directly in the underlying securities themselves. The derivatives return is linked to movements in the underlying asset. Any income the fund generates will be reinvested to grow the value of your investment. You can buy and sell shares on most working days in Dublin, exceptions to this are more fully described in the Fund Holiday Calendar available from the Administrator.","The investment objective of the Fund is to seek to maximise total return, consistent with prudent investment management. The Fund invests at least two-thirds of its total net assets in a diversified portfolio of high yield Fixed Income Instruments that are denominated in major world currencies and are rated lower than Baa by Moody’s or BBB by S&P or equivalently rated by Fitch. The Fund may invest up to 20% of its total net assets in high yield Fixed Income Instruments that are rated Caa or lower by Moody’s or CCC or lower by S&P or equivalently rated by Fitch (or, if unrated, determined by the Investment Advisor to be of a comparable quality).

Typically at least 75% of the invested assets will be held in contingent convertible bonds (“CoCos”) issued by banks, finance and insurance companies. A CoCo is a type of bond which, upon a pre-specified trigger event, may convert into either a set number of Company shares, or may be subject to a partial or full write-off. Examples of trigger events include pre-defined capital ratios of the issuer falling to a particular level, or the issue/issuer being subject to a regulatory action or decision by the responsible regulator in the issuer's home market. The Fund may invest up to 100% in sub-investment grade bonds and similar debt investments (e.g. those with a rating of below BBB- as rated by Standard and Poor’s or below Baa3 by Moody’s). For those investments not denominated in US Dollars, the Fund may use techniques to try to reduce the effects of changes in the exchange rate between US Dollars and other currencies (i.e. hedging). This aims to protect the Fund against losses caused by currency movements between the Fund base currency, US Dollars, and the currency of the non US Dollar denominated assets of the Fund. The Fund is managed having regard to the Bloomberg Barclays Contingent Capital Western Europe Index, however the Fund does not track the Index. The Fund will also use derivatives (i.e. financial contracts whose value is linked to the expected price movements of an underlying investment), with the aim of generating returns and/or reducing the overall costs and risks of the Fund. Recommendation: the Fund may not be appropriate for investors who plan to withdraw their money within 5 years. Treatment of income: As shares in this class are accumulation shares, income from investments will be reinvested into the Fund and reflected in the value of the shares. Dealing: you can buy and sell shares on business days where retail banks are open for business in Dublin and London (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays).",The fund aims to generate a total return,,https://doc.morningstar.com/LatestDoc.aspx?clientid=magnumhk&key=4e7d32ed0acb6ed9&language=451&investmentid=F00000Z71X&documenttype=52&market=1447&investmenttype=1,N/A,https://doc.morningstar.com/LatestDoc.aspx?clientid=magnumhk&key=4e7d32ed0acb6ed9&language=451&investmentid=F00000Z71X&documenttype=4&market=1447&investmenttype=1,https://doc.morningstar.com/LatestDoc.aspx?clientid=magnumhk&key=4e7d32ed0acb6ed9&language=451&investmentid=F00000Z71X&documenttype=5&market=1447&investmenttype=1,https://doc.morningstar.com/LatestDoc.aspx?clientid=magnumhk&key=4e7d32ed0acb6ed9&language=451&investmentid=F00000Z71X&documenttype=1&market=1447&investmenttype=1,,,,,,0.0177,2021/6/30,0.015,EUCA000771,2022/1/6

Duration measures the sensitivity of fixed income securities to interest rate risk. The longer the duration the higher the sensitivity to changes in interest rates. The fund invests in “non-investment grade” securities. Non-investment grade securities are considered to be more risky, but typically produce a higher level of income. The fund will invest substantially in emerging markets, which in investment terms are those economies that are not as developed.","The investment objective of the Fund is to seek maximum total return consistent with prudent investment management. The Fund invests in a combination of Fixed Income Instruments of issuers that are economically tied to Asia ex-Japan countries and related derivatives on such securities. Fixed Income Securities purchased by the Fund will be rated at least C by Moody’s or equivalently by S&P or equivalently rated by Fitch (or if unrated, determined by the Investment Advisor to be of comparable quality) with the exception of mortgage-backed securities for which there is no minimum credit rating requirement. The Fund will not necessarily sell a security when its rating is reduced below its rating at the time of purchase and the Fund may retain such securities if the Investment Advisor deems it in the best interests of Shareholders.",本基金的投资目标为于符合审慎投资管理原则的前提下，寻求达致最高水平的总回报。 本基金投资于固定收益工具（其发行机构与亚洲（日本除外）国家在经济上有连系）及该等证券的相关衍 生工具（其类别于下文详述）之组合。本基金购买的固定收益证券将最少获穆迪给予 C 评级或标准普尔给 予的同等评级或惠誉给予的同等评级（或如未有评级，则须获投资顾问确定为具备相若质素），但并无最 低信贷评级规定的按揭保证证券例外。当证券的评级跌至低于其购买当时的评级时，本基金未必会出售证 券，而若投资顾问认为保留有关证券符合股东的最佳利益，则本基金可保留有关证券。,https://doc.morningstar.com/LatestDoc.aspx?clientid=magnumhk&key=4e7d32ed0acb6ed9&language=451&investmentid=F000011KT9&documenttype=52&market=1447&investmenttype=1,https://doc.morningstar.com/LatestDoc.aspx?clientid=magnumhk&key=4e7d32ed0acb6ed9&language=451&investmentid=F000011KT9&documenttype=76&market=1447&investmenttype=1,https://doc.morningstar.com/LatestDoc.aspx?clientid=magnumhk&key=4e7d32ed0acb6ed9&language=451&investmentid=F000011KT9&documenttype=4&market=1447&investmenttype=1,https://doc.morningstar.com/LatestDoc.aspx?clientid=magnumhk&key=4e7d32ed0acb6ed9&language=451&investmentid=F000011KT9&documenttype=5&market=1447&investmenttype=1,https://doc.morningstar.com/LatestDoc.aspx?clientid=magnumhk&key=4e7d32ed0acb6ed9&language=451&investmentid=F000011KT9&documenttype=1&market=1447&investmenttype=1,64,30,34,31,,0.0155,2021/6/30,0.0155,EUCA000877,2022/1/6
