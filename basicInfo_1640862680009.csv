Investment Policy: The fund invests primarily in an actively managed globally diversified portfolio which at least 80% of its Net Asset Value is invested in fixed income instruments. - The fixed income instruments in which the Fund invests may include government bonds, covered bonds, global corporate bonds, notes, debentures, government obligations and sovereign issues, commercial paper, asset-backed securities (“ABS”), commercial and residential- mortgage backed securities (“CMBS” and “RMBS”). The Fund may invest in investment grade and up to 50% of the Fund’s Net Asset Value in sub- investment grade fixed income instruments; up to 25% of its Net Asset Value in collateralised and/or securitised products such as covered bonds, ABS, CMBS and RMBS; and up to 10% of its Net Asset Value in securities issued and/or guaranteed by a single sovereign (including its government, a public or local government of that country) which is rated sub-investment grade. An investment grade fixed income security is one which carries a lower (but not zero) degree of risk than sub-investment grade fixed income securities, as such investment grade fixed income securities typically carry a lower rate of interest than higher yielding fixed income securities. - The fund may use derivative instruments for both investment and hedging purposes. The return on a derivative is linked to movements in an underlying instrument referenced by the derivative such as currency or interest rates. The base currency of the fund is USD. Distribution Policy: Income will be declared and distributed as a dividend semi-annually. Dealing Frequency: Daily. Investors can buy and sell their shares on demand on each Business Day (as defined in the prospectus and supplement). Benchmark: FTSE World Government Bond Index'. The fund is actively managed and is not designed to track the Benchmark so its performance may deviate materially from the Benchmark. The investment manager will manage global exposure of the fund to within 200% of the Benchmark's value-at-risk (""VaR”). The VaR of a fund is a daily estimation of the maximum loss which a fund may incur over a 1 day period. The investment manager has complete discretion in making investments and is not otherwise constrained by the Benchmark. The fund may invest significantly in instruments which are not included in the Benchmark. As well as this, the Benchmark is used only for risk management and performance comparison purposes. The investment manager may consider, for example, issuer exposures, duration, sector weights, country weights, credit ratings and tracking error in each case relative to the Benchmark but (other than as set out above) does not use the Benchmark as an investment limitation. For further details please refer to the prospectus and supplement.","The investment objective of the Fund is to seek a maximum total return, through current income generation and capital appreciation. The “total return” sought by the Fund consists of income and capital appreciation, if any, w hich generally arises from decreases in interest rates or improving credit fundamentals for a particular government, industry sector or security.","本基金的目标是达至具吸引力的收益水平，同时有可能达至资产值的长期增值。按经理人的政策，本基金将持有一个国际性的多元化公司及政府定息證券投资组合。","https://doc.morningstar.com/LatestDoc.aspx?clientid=demo&key=morningstardata&language=451&investmentid=F0GBR04SJ5&documenttype=52&market=1447&investmenttype=1","https://doc.morningstar.com/LatestDoc.aspx?clientid=demo&key=morningstardata&language=451&investmentid=F0GBR04SJ5&documenttype=76&market=1447&investmenttype=1","https://doc.morningstar.com/LatestDoc.aspx?clientid=demo&key=morningstardata&language=451&investmentid=F0GBR04SJ5&documenttype=4&market=1447&investmenttype=1","https://doc.morningstar.com/LatestDoc.aspx?clientid=demo&key=morningstardata&language=451&investmentid=F0GBR04SJ5&documenttype=5&market=1447&investmenttype=1","https://doc.morningstar.com/LatestDoc.aspx?clientid=demo&key=morningstardata&language=451&investmentid=F0GBR04SJ5&documenttype=1&market=1447&investmenttype=1","27","65","56","95","27","0.012000","2021-04-30","0.007500","EUCA000759","2021-12-27"

The fund invests primarily in a range of ""investment grade"" fixed income securities (which are loans that pay a fixed or variable rate of interest) issued by companies or governments from around the world. Securities will be priced in a range of global currencies. The investment advisor will choose securities with varying repayment dates based on its expectations for interest rate and exchange rate changes. The fund may invest substantially in emerging markets, which in investment terms are those economies that are still developing. Investment grade securities, as determined by international ratings agencies, whilst potentially producing a lower level of income than ""noninvestment grade"" securities, are also considered to be of lower risk. The fund may also invest up to 10% in securities which are rated lower than ""BBB"" but rated at least ""B"" by these same agencies. These are generally considered to be riskier investments but pay a higher income. The fund's benchmark is the Barclays Capital Global Aggregate Index (USD ). It is used to measure duration. Duration is the sensitivity of a fixed income security to a change in interest rates. The longer the duration of a fixed income security, the higher its sensitivity to interest rates. For full investment objectives and policy details please refer to the prospectus. The fund may invest in derivative instruments (such as futures, options and swaps) rather than directly in the underlying securities themselves. The derivatives return is linked to movements in the underlying asset. Any income the fund generates will be paid out to your bank account or automatically reinvested in shares depending upon your election. You can buy and sell shares on most working days in Dublin, exceptions to this are more fully described in the Fund Holiday Calendar available from the Administrator.","The investment objective of the Fund is to seek to maximise total return, consistent with preservation of capital and prudent investment management. The Fund invests at least two-thirds of its assets in a diversified portfolio of Fixed Income Instruments denominated in major world currencies. The average portfolio duration of this Fund will normally vary within three years (plus or minus) of the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index (the “Index”). The Index provides a broad-based measure of the global investment-grade fixed income markets. The three major components of this Index are the U.S. Aggregate, the Pan-European Aggregate, and the AsianPacific Aggregate Indices. The Index also includes Eurodollar and EuroYen corporate bonds, Canadian Government securities, and USD investment grade 144A securities. Details of the duration of the Index will be available from the Investment Advisor upon request.","本基金的目标是在保存资本及审慎投资管理的原则下，赚取最高总回报（即透过深入研究及慎重考虑，确立及施行一些贯彻一致、规律严格并具成本效益的投资的策略，以及持续监察个别证券与总投资组合的风险）。本基金将其最少三分之二的资产投资于一项以全球各种主要货币计价的固定收益工具（可包括由政府、主权机构、企业 等发行的证券）组成的多元化投资组合。本基金主要投资于投资级别固定收益工具，惟可将其资产最多达10%投资于评级低于穆迪的Baa 或标准普尔的BBB 评级或获惠誉给予的同等评级，但最少须获穆迪或标准普尔给予B 评级或获惠誉给予同等评级（或若未有评级，则须获投资顾问视为具备相若质素）的固定收益工具，但并无最低信贷评级规定的按揭保证证券例外。虽然对按揭证券并无最低信贷评级规定，但在计算低于投资级别证券的上述 10%限额时将计及低于投资 级别的按揭证券。","https://doc.morningstar.com/LatestDoc.aspx?clientid=demo&key=morningstardata&language=446&investmentid=F0GBR067Y1&documenttype=52&market=1447&investmenttype=1","https://doc.morningstar.com/LatestDoc.aspx?clientid=demo&key=morningstardata&language=451&investmentid=F0GBR067Y1&documenttype=76&market=1447&investmenttype=1","https://doc.morningstar.com/LatestDoc.aspx?clientid=demo&key=morningstardata&language=451&investmentid=F0GBR067Y1&documenttype=4&market=1447&investmenttype=1","https://doc.morningstar.com/LatestDoc.aspx?clientid=demo&key=morningstardata&language=451&investmentid=F0GBR067Y1&documenttype=5&market=1447&investmenttype=1","https://doc.morningstar.com/LatestDoc.aspx?clientid=demo&key=morningstardata&language=451&investmentid=F0GBR067Y1&documenttype=1&market=1447&investmenttype=1","50","70","74","73","50","0.013900","2021-06-30","0.013900","EUCA000759","2021-12-29"

Investment Policy The fund aims to achieve its objective by investing primarily in a range of fixed income securities and instruments (which are loans that pay a fixed or variable rate of interest). The fund will mainly invest in emerging markets, which in investment terms are those economies that are not as developed. The fund is likely to concentrate its investments in Asia, Africa, the Middle East, Latin America and the developing countries of Europe. The average portfolio duration of this fund will normally be within two years (plus or minus) of the JP Morgan Emerging Markets Bond Index (EMBI) Global.

Investments may also be linked to emerging market countries, which in investment terms are those economies that are still developing. These high yield investments have a rating lower than ""Baa"" from Moody's or ""BBB"" from S&P, reflecting the higher risk of an institution defaulting on its payments.

The fund's benchmark is the BofA Merrill Lynch Global High Yield BB B Rated Constrained Index (USD ). It is used to measure duration. Duration is the sensitivity of a fixed income security to a change in interest rates. The longer the duration of a fixed income security, the higher its sensitivity to interest rates.

Investment Policy The fund is an actively managed portfolio which seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing primarily in a diversified pool of corporate and emerging market fixed income securities and instruments (which are loans that pay a fixed or variable rate of interest) issued by companies or governments from around the world. The fund’s average portfolio duration will normally be within positive or negative two years of that of the fund’s benchmark (an equally weighted blend of the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Credit ex-Emerging Markets, the ICE BofAML BB-B Rated Developed Markets High Yield Constrained and the JPMorgan EMBI Global, indices (all USD hedged)). Duration measures the sensitivity of the assets to interest rate risk. The longer the duration the higher the sensitivity to changes in interest rates. The securities will be both “investment grade” and “non-investment grade. Non-investment grade securities are considered to be more risky, but typically produce a higher level of income. The fund may invest substantially in emerging markets, which in investment terms are those economies that are still developing. The fund may invest in derivative instruments (such as futures, options and swaps) rather than directly in the underlying securities themselves. The derivatives return is linked to movements in the underlying assets. The assets held by the fund will mainly be in US Dollars but may be denominated in a wide variety of currencies.

The fund invests primarily in a range of ""high yield"" fixed income securities (which are loans that pay a fixed or variable rate of interest) issued by companies from around the world. These will mainly be priced in US Dollars but the fund may also hold other currencies as well as securities that are priced in other currencies. Investments may also be linked to emerging market countries, which in investment terms are those economies that are still developing. These high yield investments have a rating lower than ""Baa"" from Moody's or ""BBB"" from S&P, reflecting the higher risk of an institution defaulting on its payments. The fund may also invest up to 20% in lower rated securities of ""Caa"" and ""CCC"" by these same agencies. These are generally considered to be riskier investments but pay a higher income. The fund's benchmark is the BofA Merrill Lynch Global High Yield BB B Rated Constrained Index (USD ). It is used to measure duration. Duration is the sensitivity of a fixed income security to a change in interest rates. The longer the duration of a fixed income security, the higher its sensitivity to interest rates.

The fund may invest in derivative instruments (such as futures, options and swaps) rather than directly in the underlying securities themselves.

The average portfolio duration of the fund will normally vary within two years (plus or minus) of the duration of the JP Morgan JACI Non- Investment Grade Index. Duration measures the sensitivity of fixed income securities to interest rate risk. The longer the duration the higher the sensitivity to changes in interest rates. The fund invests in “non-investment grade” securities. Non-investment grade securities are considered to be more risky, but typically produce a higher level of income. The fund will invest substantially in emerging markets, which in investment terms are those economies that are not as developed.","The investment objective of the Fund is to seek maximum total return consistent with prudent investment management.

Investment Policy The fund aims to achieve this objective by investing in a combination of fixed income securities (which are similar to loans and pay a fixed or variable rate of interest) issued by companies or governments that are economically tied to Asian countries (excluding Japan) and related derivatives on such fixed income securities. The average portfolio duration of the fund will normally vary within two years (plus or minus) of the duration of the JP Morgan JACI Non- Investment Grade Index. Duration measures the sensitivity of fixed income securities to interest rate risk. The longer the duration the higher the sensitivity to changes in interest rates. The fund invests in “non-investment grade” securities. Non-investment grade securities are considered to be more risky, but typically produce a higher level of income. The fund will invest substantially in emerging markets, which in investment terms are those economies that are not as developed.","The investment objective of the Fund is to seek maximum total return consistent with prudent investment management.

The fund will concentrate its investments in securities from issuers domiciled in Asia ex-Japan but may invest up to one third of its total assets in fixed income instruments from issuers domiciled outside Asia ex-Japan. The fund is considered to be actively managed in reference to the JPMorgan Asia Credit Index (JACI) (the “Index”) by virtue of the fact that the Index is used for calculating the global exposure of the fund using the relative VaR methodology and for performance comparison purposes.

However, the Index is not used to define the portfolio composition of the fund or as a performance target and the fund may be wholly invested in securities which are not constituents of the Index. The average portfolio duration of the fund will normally vary between 2 and 8 years based on the investment advisor’s forecast for interest rates. Duration measures the sensitivity of the fixed income securities to interest rate risk. The longer the duration the higher the sensitivity to changes in interest rates. The fund invests in “investment grade” and “non-investment grade” securities. The fund may invest up to 50% of total assets in “noninvestment grade” securities. Non-investment grade securities are considered to be more risky, but typically produce a higher level of income. The fund may invest in emerging markets, which in investment terms are those economies that are not as developed. Emerging markets exposure may be denominated in USD or local currencies. The fund may invest in derivative instruments (such as futures, options and swaps) rather than directly in the underlying securities themselves.

Policy: the Fund will invest in company shares and similar investments listed anywhere in the world. Companies may be of all sizes (e.g. small, medium and large companies) and their operations and activities will be focused on gold and silver mining or holding bullion on a secure basis for shareholders. The Fund will also invest in Exchange Traded Funds and similar investments listed anywhere in the world. These will be used to provide the Fund with exposure to the movement of the price on Gold and Silver. The Fund will typically invest in the shares of fewer than 60 companies. The Fund may use derivatives (i.e. financial contracts whose value is linked to the expected price movements of an underlying investment) with the aim of generating returns and reducing the overall costs and/or risks of the Fund. The Fund may take long or short positions through the use of derivatives, which may result in the Fund being leveraged. Leverage magnifies the exposure of the Fund to greater than the underlying investments. In such situations, returns may rise or fall more than they would have done otherwise, reflecting such additional exposure. Recommendation：the Fund may not be appropriate for investors who plan to withdraw their money within 5 years. Treatment of income：income from investments will be retained within the Fund. This will increase the value of your shares. Dealing：you can buy and sell shares on business days where retail banks are open for business in Dublin, London, and the New York Stock Exchange is open for business in New York (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays).","The investment objective of the fund is to seek to achieve a total return by investing predominantly in listed equities.","","N/A","https://doc.morningstar.com/LatestDoc.aspx?clientid=demo&key=morningstardata&language=451&investmentid=F00000WWH5&documenttype=76&market=1447&investmenttype=1","https://doc.morningstar.com/LatestDoc.aspx?clientid=demo&key=morningstardata&language=451&investmentid=F00000WWH5&documenttype=4&market=1447&investmenttype=1","https://doc.morningstar.com/LatestDoc.aspx?clientid=demo&key=morningstardata&language=451&investmentid=F00000WWH5&documenttype=5&market=1447&investmenttype=1","https://doc.morningstar.com/LatestDoc.aspx?clientid=demo&key=morningstardata&language=451&investmentid=F00000WWH5&documenttype=1&market=1447&investmenttype=1","80","69","85","38","36","0.008400","2021-06-30","0.007500","EUCA000646","2021-12-26"

The Fund is actively managed, and the IA has discretion to select the Fund's investments. In doing, the IA will refer to the MSCI World Health Care Index (the “Index”) when constructing the Fund’s portfolio, and also for risk management purposes to ensure that the active risk (i.e. degree of deviation from the Index) taken by the Fund remains appropriate given the Fund’s investment objective and policy. The IA is not bound by the components or weighting of the Index when selecting investments. The IA may also use its discretion to invest in securities not included in the Index in order to take advantage of specific investment opportunities. However, the sector requirements of the investment objective and policy may have the effect of limiting the extent to which the portfolio holdings will deviate from the Index.

The Fund invests at least 80% of its total assets in fixed income (FI) securities. These include bonds and money market instruments (i.e. debt securities with short term maturities). The FI securities may be issued by the United States (US) government and its agencies, non-US, governments and government agencies, and companies and supranationals (e.g. the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development) domiciled inside or outside of the US. At least 80% of the Fund’s total assets will be investment grade (i.e. meet a specified level of credit worthiness) at the time of purchase. The remainder may include investments with a relatively low credit rating or which are unrated. At least 70% of the Fund’s total assets will be invested in securities that are denominated in US dollars with a duration of less than five years. Duration is a measure of the average time it takes the Fund to get its return (both capital and income) on the investments it holds. The average duration (which is duration adjusted for the proportion in which the Fund holds each investment) is not more than three years. The investment adviser (IA) may use financial derivative instruments (FDIs) (i.e. investments the prices of which are based on one or more underlying assets) for investment purposes in order to achieve the investment objective of the Fund, and/or to reduce risk within the Fund’s portfolio, reduce investment costs and generate additional income. The Fund may, via FDIs, generate varying amounts of market leverage (i.e. where the Fund gains market exposure in excess of the value of its assets).

The term Europe refers to European countries including, Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union countries but excludes the United Kingdom. Depending on market conditions, the Fund will aim to invest in equity securities of companies that are, in the investment adviser’s (IA) opinion, undervalued (i.e. their share price does not reflect their underlying worth) or have good growth potential.

The IA is not bound by the components or weighting of the Index when selecting investments. The IA may also use its discretion to invest in securities not included in the Index in order to take advantage of specific investment opportunities.

Portfolio securities The Sub-Fund invests mainly in shares of companies of varied size that are located, registered, or doing significant business in Japan. The Sub-Fund may also invest in bonds and currencies. Investment process In choosing investments, the investment manager looks for shares that are undervalued and that appear to have the potential to rise in price over the long term. The Sub-Fund may use derivatives for efficient portfolio management or to manage risks. Benchmark This Sub-Fund aims to outperform the return of MSCI Japan Index (""Benchmark""). The Sub-Fund is actively managed. The Benchmark is used as a reference point for portfolio construction. The majority of the Sub-Fund's equity securities will be components of, and have weightings derived from the Benchmark. The Investment Manager may use its discretion to overweight or underweight certain components of the Benchmark and may invest in companies or sectors not included in the Benchmark in order to take advantage of specific investment opportunities. It is thus expected that the performance of the Sub-Fund will materially deviate from the Benchmark. Base Currency JPY / Share class reference currency USD Recommendation This Sub-Fund may not be appropriate for investors who plan to withdraw their money within 7 years. Terms to Understand Bonds Securities that represent the obligation to repay a debt, with interest. Derivatives Financial instruments whose value is linked to one or more rates, indexes, share prices or other values. Shares Securities that represent an ownership stake in a company. You can place orders to buy or sell shares at any time. Orders placed before 2 PM (Luxembourg time) and on any day that is a banking day in Luxembourg and in the country or countries where the majority of the Sub-Fund's assets are invested will generally be processed that day. The Sub-Fund offers both accumulation shares (shares in which any dividends received are added to the share price) and dividend shares (shares in which any dividends received are paid out to investors).","This Sub-Fund aims to generate long-term capital growth through a concentrated portfolio of equities, equity-related securities, bonds and currencies. The Sub-Fund will invest primarily in securities of companies, which are incorporated, listed in or have their area of primary activity in Japan. The Sub-Fund may also invest in depository receipts including ADRs and GDRs, convertible bonds, preference shares, warrants and fixed income securities issued by Japan entities.","子基金以透过集中投资股票、股票相关证券、债券及货币之方式达到长期资本增长为目标。本子基金将主要投资于在日本设立、上市或其主要活动在日本之公司的证券。本子基金得投资于日本企业发行之存托凭证（包括美国存托凭证及全球存托凭证）、可转换债券、优先股、认股权证及固定收益证券。","https://doc.morningstar.com/LatestDoc.aspx?clientid=demo&key=morningstardata&language=446&investmentid=F00000M7SZ&documenttype=52&market=1447&investmenttype=1","https://doc.morningstar.com/LatestDoc.aspx?clientid=demo&key=morningstardata&language=451&investmentid=F00000M7SZ&documenttype=76&market=1447&investmenttype=1","https://doc.morningstar.com/LatestDoc.aspx?clientid=demo&key=morningstardata&language=451&investmentid=F00000M7SZ&documenttype=4&market=1447&investmenttype=1","https://doc.morningstar.com/LatestDoc.aspx?clientid=demo&key=morningstardata&language=451&investmentid=F00000M7SZ&documenttype=5&market=1447&investmenttype=1","https://doc.morningstar.com/LatestDoc.aspx?clientid=demo&key=morningstardata&language=446&investmentid=F00000M7SZ&documenttype=1&market=1447&investmenttype=1","100","100","98","3","93","0.016000","2021-06-30","0.015000","EUCA000521","2021-12-30"

Portfolio securities The Sub-Fund invests mainly in shares of companies of varied size that are located, registered, or doing significant business in Japan. The Sub-Fund may also invest in bonds and currencies. Investment process In choosing investments, the investment manager looks for shares that are undervalued and that appear to have the potential to rise in price over the long term. The Sub-Fund may use derivatives for efficient portfolio management or to manage risks. Benchmark This Sub-Fund aims to outperform the return of MSCI Japan Index (""Benchmark""). The Sub-Fund is actively managed. The Benchmark is used as a reference point for portfolio construction. The majority of the Sub-Fund's equity securities will be components of, and have weightings derived from the Benchmark. The Investment Manager may use its discretion to overweight or underweight certain components of the Benchmark and may invest in companies or sectors not included in the Benchmark in order to take advantage of specific investment opportunities. It is thus expected that the performance of the Sub-Fund will materially deviate from the Benchmark. Base Currency JPY / Share class reference currency USD Your shares will be “hedged” with the aim of protecting them from exchange rate fluctuations between their denominated currency (the “Share class reference currency”) and the base currency of the Fund. Hedging also has the effect of limiting the potential for currency gains to be made. Recommendation This Sub-Fund may not be appropriate for investors who plan to withdraw their money within 7 years. Terms to Understand Bonds Securities that represent the obligation to repay a debt, with interest. Derivatives Financial instruments whose value is linked to one or more rates, indexes, share prices or other values. Shares Securities that represent an ownership stake in a company. You can place orders to buy or sell shares at any time. Orders placed before 2 PM (Luxembourg time) and on any day that is a banking day in Luxembourg and in the country or countries where the majority of the Sub-Fund's assets are invested will generally be processed that day. The Sub-Fund offers both accumulation shares (shares in which any dividends received are added to the share price) and dividend shares (shares in which any dividends received are paid out to investors).","This Sub-Fund aims to generate long-term capital growth through a concentrated portfolio of equities, equity-related securities, bonds and currencies.
