Investment Policy: The fund invests primarily in an actively managed globally diversified portfolio which at least 80% of its Net Asset Value is invested in fixed income instruments. - The fixed income instruments in which the Fund invests may include government bonds, covered bonds, global corporate bonds, notes, debentures, government obligations and sovereign issues, commercial paper, asset-backed securities (“ABS”), commercial and residential- mortgage backed securities (“CMBS” and “RMBS”). The Fund may invest in investment grade and up to 50% of the Fund’s Net Asset Value in sub- investment grade fixed income instruments; up to 25% of its Net Asset Value in collateralised and/or securitised products such as covered bonds, ABS, CMBS and RMBS; and up to 10% of its Net Asset Value in securities issued and/or guaranteed by a single sovereign (including its government, a public or local government of that country) which is rated sub-investment grade. An investment grade fixed income security is one which carries a lower (but not zero) degree of risk than sub-investment grade fixed income securities, as such investment grade fixed income securities typically carry a lower rate of interest than higher yielding fixed income securities. - The fund may use derivative instruments for both investment and hedging purposes. The return on a derivative is linked to movements in an underlying instrument referenced by the derivative such as currency or interest rates. The base currency of the fund is USD. Distribution Policy: Income will be declared and distributed as a dividend semi-annually. Dealing Frequency: Daily. Investors can buy and sell their shares on demand on each Business Day (as defined in the prospectus and supplement). Benchmark: FTSE World Government Bond Index'. The fund is actively managed and is not designed to track the Benchmark so its performance may deviate materially from the Benchmark. The investment manager will manage global exposure of the fund to within 200% of the Benchmark's value-at-risk (""VaR”). The VaR of a fund is a daily estimation of the maximum loss which a fund may incur over a 1 day period. The investment manager has complete discretion in making investments and is not otherwise constrained by the Benchmark. The fund may invest significantly in instruments which are not included in the Benchmark. As well as this, the Benchmark is used only for risk management and performance comparison purposes. The investment manager may consider, for example, issuer exposures, duration, sector weights, country weights, credit ratings and tracking error in each case relative to the Benchmark but (other than as set out above) does not use the Benchmark as an investment limitation.

The fund invests primarily in a range of ""investment grade"" fixed income securities (which are loans that pay a fixed or variable rate of interest) issued by companies or governments from around the world. Securities will be priced in a range of global currencies. The investment advisor will choose securities with varying repayment dates based on its expectations for interest rate and exchange rate changes. The fund may invest substantially in emerging markets, which in investment terms are those economies that are still developing. Investment grade securities, as determined by international ratings agencies, whilst potentially producing a lower level of income than ""noninvestment grade"" securities, are also considered to be of lower risk. The fund may also invest up to 10% in securities which are rated lower than ""BBB"" but rated at least ""B"" by these same agencies. These are generally considered to be riskier investments but pay a higher income. The fund's benchmark is the Barclays Capital Global Aggregate Index (USD ). It is used to measure duration. Duration is the sensitivity of a fixed income security to a change in interest rates. The longer the duration of a fixed income security, the higher its sensitivity to interest rates. For full investment objectives and policy details please refer to the prospectus. The fund may invest in derivative instruments (such as futures, options and swaps) rather than directly in the underlying securities themselves. The derivatives return is linked to movements in the underlying asset.

Typically at least 75% of the invested assets will be held in contingent convertible bonds (“CoCos”) issued by banks, finance and insurance companies. A CoCo is a type of bond which, upon a pre-specified trigger event, may convert into either a set number of Company shares, or may be subject to a partial or full write-off. Examples of trigger events include pre-defined capital ratios of the issuer falling to a particular level, or the issue/issuer being subject to a regulatory action or decision by the responsible regulator in the issuer's home market. The Fund may invest up to 100% in sub-investment grade bonds and similar debt investments (e.g. those with a rating of below BBB- as rated by Standard and Poor’s or below Baa3 by Moody’s). For those investments not denominated in US Dollars, the Fund may use techniques to try to reduce the effects of changes in the exchange rate between US Dollars and other currencies (i.e. hedging). This aims to protect the Fund against losses caused by currency movements between the Fund base currency, US Dollars, and the currency of the non US Dollar denominated assets of the Fund. The Fund is managed having regard to the Bloomberg Barclays Contingent Capital Western Europe Index, however the Fund does not track the Index. The Fund will also use derivatives (i.e. financial contracts whose value is linked to the expected price movements of an underlying investment), with the aim of generating returns and/or reducing the overall costs and risks of the Fund. Recommendation: the Fund may not be appropriate for investors who plan to withdraw their money within 5 years. Treatment of income: As shares in this class are accumulation shares, income from investments will be reinvested into the Fund and reflected in the value of the shares.

Emerging markets are regions of the world that are still developing their economies. The fixed income instruments in which the Fund invests may include corporate bonds and notes, sovereign issues, covered bonds, commercial paper and other income securities. The Fund invests at least 60% of its net assets in sovereign issues. Up to 20% of the Fund's net assets can be invested in securities rated lower than B- by Standard & Poors (S&P) or another internationally recognised rating agency or, if unrated, determined by the investment manager to be of a comparable quality.

Long-term capital appreciation is a secondary objective. Investment Policy The fund invests in a broad array of fixed income instruments (which are similar to loans and pay a fixed or variable rate of interest) issued by companies or governments. The fund will concentrate its investments in securities from issuers domiciled in Asia ex-Japan but may invest up to one third of its total assets in fixed income instruments from issuers domiciled outside Asia ex-Japan. The fund is considered to be actively managed in reference to the JPMorgan Asia Credit Index (JACI) (the “Index”) by virtue of the fact that the Index is used for calculating the global exposure of the fund using the relative VaR methodology and for performance comparison purposes. Certain of the fund’s securities may be components of and may have similar weightings to the Index. However, the Index is not used to define the portfolio composition of the fund or as a performance target and the fund may be wholly invested in securities which are not constituents of the Index. The average portfolio duration of the fund will normally vary between 2 and 8 years based on the investment advisor’s forecast for interest rates. Duration measures the sensitivity of the fixed income securities to interest rate risk. The longer the duration the higher the sensitivity to changes in interest rates. The fund invests in “investment grade” and “non-investment grade” securities. The fund may invest up to 50% of total assets in “noninvestment grade” securities. Non-investment grade securities are considered to be more risky, but typically produce a higher level of income. The fund may invest in emerging markets, which in investment terms are those economies that are not as developed. Emerging markets exposure may be denominated in USD or local currencies. The fund may invest in derivative instruments (such as futures, options and swaps) rather than directly in the underlying securities themselves. The derivatives return is linked to movements in the underlying assets. The assets held by the fund may be denominated in a wide variety of currencies with non-USD currency exposure limited to 20% of total assets. The investment advisor may use foreign exchange and related derivative instruments to hedge or implement currency positions. For full investment objectives and policy details please refer to the fund’s prospectus. Distribution Policy This share class does not pay out a distribution. Any investment income generated will be reinvested. Dealing Day You can buy and sell shares on most working days in Dublin, exceptions to this are more fully described in the fund holiday calendar available from the Administrator.","The primary investment objective of the Fund is to seek to generate attractive and stable income.

Long-term capital appreciation is a secondary objective. Investment Policy The fund invests in a broad array of fixed income instruments (which are similar to loans and pay a fixed or variable rate of interest) issued by companies or governments. The fund will concentrate its investments in securities from issuers domiciled in Asia ex-Japan but may invest up to one third of its total assets in fixed income instruments from issuers domiciled outside Asia ex-Japan. The fund is considered to be actively managed in reference to the JPMorgan Asia Credit Index (JACI) (the “Index”) by virtue of the fact that the Index is used for calculating the global exposure of the fund using the relative VaR methodology and for performance comparison purposes. Certain of the fund’s securities may be components of and may have similar weightings to the Index. However, the Index is not used to define the portfolio composition of the fund or as a performance target and the fund may be wholly invested in securities which are not constituents of the Index. The average portfolio duration of the fund will normally vary between 2 and 8 years based on the investment advisor’s forecast for interest rates. Duration measures the sensitivity of the fixed income securities to interest rate risk. The longer the duration the higher the sensitivity to changes in interest rates. The fund invests in “investment grade” and “non-investment grade” securities. The fund may invest up to 50% of total assets in “noninvestment grade” securities. Non-investment grade securities are considered to be more risky, but typically produce a higher level of income. The fund may invest in emerging markets, which in investment terms are those economies that are not as developed. Emerging markets exposure may be denominated in USD or local currencies. The fund may invest in derivative instruments (such as futures, options and swaps) rather than directly in the underlying securities themselves. The derivatives return is linked to movements in the underlying assets. The assets held by the fund may be denominated in a wide variety of currencies with non-USD currency exposure limited to 20% of total assets. The investment advisor may use foreign exchange and related derivative instruments to hedge or implement currency positions. For full investment objectives and policy details please refer to the fund’s prospectus. Distribution Policy This share class pays out a distribution of any investment income generated by the fund. You may elect for this to be reinvested into the fund. Share Class Currency Hedging This share class does not seek to protect against movements in exchange rates by hedging (a currency transaction which can protect against such movements) which is likely to have an impact on the value of the share class.","The primary investment objective of the Fund is to seek to generate attractive and stable income.

Policy: the Fund will invest in company shares and similar investments listed anywhere in the world.

The Fund will also invest in Exchange Traded Funds and similar investments listed anywhere in the world.

The investment adviser (IA) may use financial derivative instruments (FDIs) (i.e. investments the prices of which are based on one or more underlying assets) for investment purposes in order to achieve the investment objective of the Fund, and/or to reduce risk within the Fund’s portfolio, reduce investment costs and generate additional income.

In doing, the IA will refer to the MSCI World Health Care Index (the “Index”) when constructing the Fund’s portfolio, and also for risk management purposes to ensure that the active risk (i.e. degree of deviation from the Index) taken by the Fund remains appropriate given the Fund’s investment objective and policy.

The IA may also use its discretion to invest in securities not included in the Index in order to take advantage of specific investment opportunities.

The Fund invests at least 70% of its total assets in the equity securities (e.g. shares) of companies domiciled in, or the main business of which is in, Europe excluding the United Kingdom. The term Europe refers to European countries including, Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union countries but excludes the United Kingdom. Depending on market conditions, the Fund will aim to invest in equity securities of companies that are, in the investment adviser’s (IA) opinion, undervalued (i.e. their share price does not reflect their underlying worth) or have good growth potential. The IA may use financial derivative instruments (FDIs) (i.e. investments the prices of which are based on one or more underlying assets) for investment purposes in order to achieve the investment objective of the Fund, and/or to reduce risk within the Fund’s portfolio, reduce investment costs and generate additional income. The Fund may, via FDIs, generate varying amounts of market leverage (i.e. where the Fund gains market exposure in excess of the value of its assets). The Fund is actively managed, and the IA has discretion to select the Fund's investments. In doing so the IA will refer to the FTSE World Europe ex UK Index when constructing the Fund’s portfolio, and also for risk management purposes to ensure that the active risk (i.e. degree of deviation from the index) taken by the Fund remains appropriate given the Fund’s investment objective and policy. The IA is not bound by the components or weighting of the Index when selecting investments. The IA may also use its discretion to invest in securities not included in the Index in order to take advantage of specific investment opportunities. However, the geographical scope of the investment objective and policy may have the effect of limiting the extent to which the portfolio holdings will deviate from the Index. The Index should be used by investors to compare the performance of the Fund. Recommendation: This Fund may not be appropriate for short-term investment. Your shares will be non-distributing (i.e. dividend income will be included in their value). Your shares will be denominated in Euro, the Fund's base currency. You can buy and sell your shares daily.

The Sub-Fund is actively managed. The Benchmark is used as a reference point for portfolio construction.

In addition, the Fund may, to a more limited extent, invest in equity securities listed on non-U.S. exchanges and in other similar eligible assets or instruments, such as exchange traded funds. The Fund may use derivatives (i) to gain additional exposure, (ii) for efficient portfolio management and (iii) in seeking to reduce potential risks.

Income and capital gains derived from the Fund are reinvested. Redemption Shares may be redeemed on any day when both the New York Stock Exchange and Luxembourg banks are open for business.

Portfolio securities The Sub-Fund invests mainly in shares of companies of varied size that are located, registered, or doing significant business in Japan. The Sub-Fund may also invest in bonds and currencies. Investment process In choosing investments, the investment manager looks for shares that are undervalued and that appear to have the potential to rise in price over the long term. The Sub-Fund may use derivatives for efficient portfolio management or to manage risks. Benchmark This Sub-Fund aims to outperform the return of MSCI Japan Index (""Benchmark""). The Sub-Fund is actively managed. The Benchmark is used as a reference point for portfolio construction. The majority of the Sub-Fund's equity securities will be components of, and have weightings derived from the Benchmark. The Investment Manager may use its discretion to overweight or underweight certain components of the Benchmark and may invest in companies or sectors not included in the Benchmark in order to take advantage of specific investment opportunities. It is thus expected that the performance of the Sub-Fund will materially deviate from the Benchmark. Base Currency JPY / Share class reference currency USD Your shares will be “hedged” with the aim of protecting them from exchange rate fluctuations between their denominated currency (the “Share class reference currency”) and the base currency of the Fund. Hedging also has the effect of limiting the potential for currency gains to be made. Recommendation This Sub-Fund may not be appropriate for investors who plan to withdraw their money within 7 years. Terms to Understand Bonds Securities that represent the obligation to repay a debt, with interest. Derivatives Financial instruments whose value is linked to one or more rates, indexes, share prices or other values. Shares Securities that represent an ownership stake in a company. You can place orders to buy or sell shares at any time. Orders placed before 2 PM (Luxembourg time) and on any day that is a banking day in Luxembourg and in the country or countries where the majority of the Sub-Fund's assets are invested will generally be processed that day. The Sub-Fund offers both accumulation shares (shares in which any dividends received are added to the share price) and dividend shares (shares in which any dividends received are paid out to investors).","This Sub-Fund aims to generate long-term capital growth through a concentrated portfolio of equities, equity-related securities, bonds and currencies. The Sub-Fund will invest primarily in securities of companies, which are incorporated, listed in or have their area of primary activity in Japan. The Sub-Fund may also invest in depository receipts including ADRs and GDRs, convertible bonds, preference shares, warrants and fixed income securities issued by Japan entities.","子基金以透过集中投资股票、股票相关证券、债券及货币之方式达到长期资本增长为目标。本子基金将主要投资于在日本设立、上市或其主要活动在日本之公司的证券。本子基金得投资于日本企业发行之存托凭证（包括美国存托凭证及全球存托凭证）、可转换债券、优先股、认股权证及固定收益证券。","https://doc.morningstar.com/LatestDoc.aspx?clientid=magnumhk&key=4e7d32ed0acb6ed9&language=446&investmentid=F00000QF7E&documenttype=52&market=1447&investmenttype=1","https://doc.morningstar.com/LatestDoc.aspx?clientid=magnumhk&key=4e7d32ed0acb6ed9&language=451&investmentid=F00000QF7E&documenttype=76&market=1447&investmenttype=1","https://doc.morningstar.com/LatestDoc.aspx?clientid=magnumhk&key=4e7d32ed0acb6ed9&language=451&investmentid=F00000QF7E&documenttype=4&market=1447&investmenttype=1","https://doc.morningstar.com/LatestDoc.aspx?clientid=magnumhk&key=4e7d32ed0acb6ed9&language=451&investmentid=F00000QF7E&documenttype=5&market=1447&investmenttype=1","https://doc.morningstar.com/LatestDoc.aspx?clientid=magnumhk&key=4e7d32ed0acb6ed9&language=446&investmentid=F00000QF7E&documenttype=1&market=1447&investmenttype=1","","","","","","0.016000","2021-06-30","0.015000","EUCA000521","2022-01-06"

The Fund invests in the full range of assets in which a UCITS fund may invest, including equity securities (e.g. shares), fixed income securities (such as bonds), funds, cash, deposits, money market instruments (i.e. debt securities with short term maturities) and financial derivative instruments (FDIs). The Fund invests at least 70% of its total assets in fixed income transferable securities and equity securities of issuers and companies domiciled in, or exercising the predominant part of their economic activity in, Asia, excluding Japan. The asset classes and the extent to which the Fund is invested in these may vary without limit depending on market conditions and other factors at the investment adviser’s (IA) discretion. In selecting these, the IA may take into consideration the MSCI Asia ex Japan Index (50%), the JP Morgan Asia Credit Index (25%) and the HSBC Local Bond Index (25%). The Fund’s investments may be issued by governments, government agencies, companies and supranationals (e.g. the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development). These may include securities with a relatively low credit rating or which are unrated. The assets held by the Fund may be denominated in a wide variety of currencies. The investment adviser (IA) may use financial derivative instruments (FDIs) (i.e. investments the prices of which are based on one or more underlying assets) for investment purposes in order to achieve the investment objective of the Fund, and/or to reduce risk within the Fund’s portfolio, reduce investment costs and generate additional income. The Fund may, via FDIs, generate varying amounts of market leverage (i.e. where the Fund gains market exposure in excess of the value of its assets).

Your shares will be denominated in US Dollar, the Fund's base currency. You can buy and sell your shares daily. The minimum initial investment for this share class is US$5,000 or currency equivalent.

Portfolio securities The Sub-Fund will invest primarily in equities and equity-related securities of companies, diversified across countries and sectors, which are incorporated, listed in or have their area of primary activity in the Asia Pacific ex-Japan Region. The Sub-Fund may also invest in depository receipts, including ADRs and GDRs, debt securities convertible into common shares, preference shares and warrants. Investment process In choosing investments, the investment manager starts with a broad Asia Pacific ex Japan universe of stocks and shortlists them on the basis of investability and desirable characteristics (e.g. value, positive analyst sentiment and quality among other factors). An optimization process then selects stocks from the shortlist and constructs a suitable low volatility portfolio with the desired characteristics. Constraints such as maximum stock weight, portfolio concentration, liquidity, sector, country and style relative exposures, etc. are applied in order to manage systematic and stock specific risk. Benchmark This Sub-Fund aims to outperform the return of MSCI AC Asia Pacific ex-Japan Minimum Volatility Index (""Benchmark""). The Sub-Fund is actively managed. The Benchmark is used as a reference point for portfolio construction. The majority of the Sub-Fund's equity securities will be components of, and have weightings derived from the Benchmark. The Investment Manager will use its discretion to overweight or underweight certain components of the Benchmark and may invest in companies or sectors not included in the Benchmark in order to take advantage of specific investment opportunities. It is thus expected that the performance of the Sub-Fund will moderately deviate from the Benchmark. Base Currency USD Recommendation This Sub-Fund may not be appropriate for investors who plan to withdraw their money within 7 years. Terms to Understand Derivatives Financial instruments whose value is linked to one or more rates, indexes, share prices or other values.
